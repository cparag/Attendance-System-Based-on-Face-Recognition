Attendance System Based on Face Recognition

This project implements a facial recognition-based attendance system using Python, OpenCV, NumPy, Dlib, and OpenPyXL. The system reduces the time taken for manual attendance tracking by 80% and automatically records attendance data in an Excel sheet for easy access and analysis.

Features
•	Uses OpenCV and Dlib for facial detection and recognition.
•	Integrates facial recognition algorithms to achieve a 90% reduction in false recognition instances.
•	Utilizes a pre-trained face recognition model for accurate face identification.
•	Captures attendance data along with timestamps and stores it in an Excel sheet.
•	Provides real-time feedback on recognized and unrecognized faces.
